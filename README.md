# Programming-Projects (in HighSchool)
This is the repository for my personal projects during the HighSchool

Every project is structured in two folders:
  -Build (aka the compiled version of the program)
  -Code  (the project itself)
  
I highly recommend to read every "README" from every project for better explanations of how to use / modify the project.
