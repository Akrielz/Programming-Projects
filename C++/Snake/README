Important Notes:
  -After running the game, Settings and HighScore files will appear to store the related info. If you want your progress to be held
  after you move the game in a different folder, just move those files as well.

Personal Data:
  -This game was one of my biggest projects back then, because it involved some kind of "graphics" while it was still using the
  characters from the console just colored in a different way, so I had to simulate the idea of rendering continous frames.
  -This is a personal tribute for the Snake game from the Nokia, that I raised with.
