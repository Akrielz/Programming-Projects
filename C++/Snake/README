Personal Data:
  -This game was one of my biggest projects back then, because it involved some kind of "graphics" while it was still using the
  characters from the console just colored in a different way, so I had to simulate the idea of rendering continous frames.
  -This is a personal tribute for the Snake game from the Nokia, that I raised with.
