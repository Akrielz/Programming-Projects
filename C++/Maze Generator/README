Release Date: 
  -2018 (When I was 12th grade, second semester)

Accepted Inputs:
  -None

How to use:
  -This program will automatically generate a maze on a n^2 map and solve it.
  -The n in the project is called "usedLength" and can be changed to any value that has the form of: 2^p+1
  (ex for p = 5, n = 2^5+1 = 32 + 1 = 33) and then recompiled to have the wished dimensions.
  -If you choose a high value for the usedLength, I recommend changing the font to be smaller

Known Bugs:
  -When the usedLength is not in the described form, it will have some funky behaviour
